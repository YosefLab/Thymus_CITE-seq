This repository contains code for the analysis performed in this manuscript.

The CITE-seq data generated in this manuscript are accessible through GEO: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE186078.

The thymus CITE-seq data set can be explored interactively with Vision:
  - Positive selection subset: http://s133.cs.berkeley.edu:9001/Results.html
  - Full data set: http://s133.cs.berkeley.edu:9002/Results.html
